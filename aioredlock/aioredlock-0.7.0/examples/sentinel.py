"""
This example script demonstrates how to use ``aioredlock`` with Sentinels_.
Sentinels are useful when you want to make sure that you are always hitting
the master redis instance in your cluster, even after failover.

In order to run this script, make sure to start the docker-compose setup.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose logs -f sentinel  # to follow the logs for the sentinel to see the failover

And then in another terminal run the following command to execute this script.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m examples.sentinel

.. note::

    If you are running on a Mac, you will need to enable TunTap_ so that the
    docker container ip addresses on the bridge are accessible from the mac
    host.

.. note::

    This example script requires that the ``example`` extras be installed.

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install -e .[examples]
